# Arda's Custom Events
A server plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory introducing custom events and QoL fixes.

## How to Install
Put the `Arda's Custom Events.dll` into `LabApi/plugins/global` path. You can find the .dll in the releases page.


## Features
This plugin contains several QoL features, fixes, and additions. These are specifically made to fit the needs of me and my friend group.

**QoL and Additions**:
- Player join broadcast - Displays a server wide broadcast message when a player joins.
- Role balancer - A custom role balancer that divides scp's into primary and secondary categories to make it more balanced.
- Pink Candy - Reintroduces the pink candy to SCP-330.

**Custom Events**:
- Blackout Event - All the lights are out and the scp's spawn as SCP-939 (dog). Everyone else spawns as Class D. When Class D escapes they turn into Chaos with strong weapons and have to kill the scp's. No respawn waves.
- Item Event - Everyone spawns with a random item.
- Team Deathmatch Event - Players are divided between Chaos and MTF and have to kill each other to win. Captains spawn with a jailbird and Anti SCP-207.
